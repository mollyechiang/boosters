# Booster analysis

## Cumulative Booster Administration
This script pulls the most recent CDC data (https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccinations-in-the-United-States-Jurisdi/unsk-b7fc) to visualize the cumulative percent of the population that has received an additional dose  of the COVID-19 vaccine (booster) over time. The visualizations are either shown by state or faceted by region.

Also, 7 day rolling averages of nation-wide booster administration is calculated and plotted, with relevant news clips. 

## Booster Hesitancy
Momentive survey data used to investigate individual's reasons for not getting boosted. Plots breakdown respondents into groups (demographic, willingness to get boosted, etc.) and display the groups' top reasons for not getting boosted. This analysis can provide suggestions on how to change the rhetoric in the booster campaign.
